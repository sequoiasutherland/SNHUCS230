# SNHUCS230

This project was a mock software design document for a client called The Gaming Room. This client has a game application which is available on Android devices, and they wanted to expand to a web based platform as well. 

One of the strongest points of my design document was the information included for the client on the various server OS' available to them. I included comprehensive information on all of their options so that the team could make an informed decision. 

Having a design template which structured the goals and architecture of the project was helpful when creating code because the foundational decisions had already been made, and the plan laid out. This took out some of the uncertainties of developing code as I was working in a more contained set of parameters. 

If I were to revise this document I would narrow down my focus in the recommendations section. I think that broad recommendations can be useful for a team who wants to have autonomy, but it might not be the most helpful strategy when communicating a suggestion which from the perspective of a design team should be implemented. 

The user's needs are the most important part of any project, this one included. I tried to balance fulfilling all of their requirements with giving my own input to create the best possible outcome. 

I took the strategy of designing this broadly and then focusing on each piece within the overall plan. Completing the project this way helped me to not go down any dead ends or neglect an important part of the project's functionality.
